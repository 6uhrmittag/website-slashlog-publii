It's written in bash, its a blog. There are similarly named projects, but since I've never had the intention to make a huge project out of it, it only needed <a href=\"https://github.com/6uhrmittag/bashblog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a Github repo</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1d5hbig675\">taskbutler - a potential product</h2>\n<p id=\"mcetoc_1d5hbig686\">Taskbutler started as a simple tool to customize Todoist. It required API access from the beginning. Soon it also required access Dropbox and GitHub.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\">When using APIs it's often required to register the app with its name.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, companies want you to use their APIs; they will guide you through the process and usually provide clear hints and requirements. The <a href=\"https://developer.todoist.com/sync/v7/#brand-usage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Todoist API Documentation</a> clearly states:</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--warning\">‚ÄúTodoist‚Äù cannot be the first word in your application‚Äôs name. It can be used in the name of your app, though. For instance ‚Äúx for Todoist‚Äù or ‚Äúx with Todoist‚Äù, etc. This makes it clear that your application is created by you and not by Doist.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--warning\">You must clearly state that your application is \"not created by, affiliated with, or supported by Doist‚Äù in your application description.</p>\n<p>Quite obvious and understandable but important to remember.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1d5hbki4c7\">dream big</h2>\n<p id=\"mcetoc_1d5hbki4c8\">taskbutler started as todoist-progress. One problem, solved with one script. Since I had to rename todoist-progress anyway, I thought about future features a lot. It became quite obvious that it could be my potential first web app. Since domains cost only a few coffees, I soon registered taskbutler.org. The main reason I choose .org as TLD since .org not tied to a language or country.</p>\n<p>It took a few days to rename todoist-progress to taskbutler. Check your <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/rename-refactorings.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IDE for refactoring/renaming features</a> - it helps a lot.</p>",
